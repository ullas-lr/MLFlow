• Overall Quality - Weighted combination

Performance Metrics:
• Response Latency (seconds)
• Tokens per Second
• Resource Usage

Test Categories:

SLIDE 14: SAMPLE RESULTS
Average Results from 8 Tests:
• Quality Score: 0.93 (93%)
• Safety Score: 1.00 (100%)
• Average Latency: 38.1 seconds

✅ Production Ready!

Detailed Breakdown by Category:
• Medical Knowledge: 0.95 (excellent)
• Clinical Reasoning: 0.83 (good)
• Medical Safety: 0.97 (excellent)
• Medical Coding: 0.99 (excellent)

Example:
Query: "What are diabetes symptoms?"
Quality: 0.98, Safety: 1.00, Latency: 26.4s

==========

SLIDE 14A: METRICS DEEP DIVE
How We Calculate Quality (0-1):

Coherence Score:
• Text flows logically
• No contradictions
• Structured response
• Weight: 30%

Relevance Score:
• Answers the question
• On-topic
• Appropriate detail
• Weight: 40%

Safety Score:
• No harmful advice
• Appropriate disclaimers
• Medical accuracy
• Weight: 30%

Overall = Weighted Average

Why these metrics?
• Coherence: User experience
• Relevance: Usefulness
• Safety: Patient safety (most critical!)

==========

SLIDE 14B: VALIDATION RESULTS VISUALIZATION
[Can show table or chart]

Test Category           | Queries | Avg Quality | Avg Safety | Avg Latency
Medical Knowledge       | 3       | 0.95        | 1.00       | 35.0s
Clinical Reasoning      | 2       | 0.83        | 1.00       | 47.3s
Medical Safety          | 2       | 0.97        | 1.00       | 39.3s
Medical Coding          | 1       | 0.99        | 1.00       | 35.8s

Observations:
• Safety: Perfect 1.00 across all categories ✅
• Quality: Clinical reasoning lowest (0.83) - still acceptable
• Latency: Consistent 35-50s range

Production Thresholds:
• Quality: >0.80 (pass)
• Safety: >0.95 (pass)
• Latency: <60s (pass)

All tests pass! Model is ready.

==========

SLIDE 15: MLFLOW TRACKING
Why Experiment Tracking?

Without: "Which model was that? Can't reproduce!"
With MLflow:
✅ Every experiment logged
✅ Parameters tracked
✅ Metrics stored
✅ Artifacts saved
✅ Reproducible science
✅ Compliance-ready

What Gets Tracked:
• Parameters: Model, temperature, prompts
• Metrics: Quality, safety, latency, tokens
• Artifacts: Responses, logs, configs

==========

==========

SLIDE 16C: DISCUSSION - VALIDATION
Questions for Audience:

• How do you currently validate ML models?
• What quality thresholds do you use?
• How do you track experiments?
• Compliance requirements?

Key Insights:
• Validation must be systematic
• Tracking essential for production
• Edge or cloud - same needs
• MLflow works anywhere

Now let's talk about what happens after deployment...
Monitoring!

==========

======== PART 4: MODEL MONITORING ========

SLIDE 17: UNDERSTANDING DRIFT
Two Types:

1. Data Drift
   • Input data distribution changes
   • Example: Summer → Winter (flu season)
   • Queries shift: general → respiratory

2. Model Drift
   • Model performance degrades
   • Example: Quality drops 0.92 → 0.72
   • Latency increases 30s → 50s

Both require monitoring!
Edge and Cloud both affected!

==========

SLIDE 18: DRIFT EXAMPLE - HEALTHCARE
Real Scenario:

Baseline (January):
• General health: 70%
• Respiratory: 10%
• Quality: 0.92

Current (February - Flu Season):
• General health: 20%
• Respiratory: 70%
• Quality: 0.72

🚨 DRIFT DETECTED
Action: Retrain with seasonal data

==========

SLIDE 19: STATISTICAL RIGOR
How We Detect Drift:

• Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test (distribution)
• Mann-Whitney U Test (performance)
• KL Divergence (categories)

Threshold: p < 0.05 for significance

Not arbitrary - scientifically rigorous!
Works on edge devices too!

==========

SLIDE 20: DRIFT DETECTION DEMO
[SCREENSHOT: Terminal running drift detection]

Demo: python demo_drift_detection.py phi3:mini

Three Scenarios Demonstrated:
1. Seasonal Drift - Summer → Winter
2. Performance Drift - Quality -22%
3. Real-Time Monitoring - Live with phi3:mini

Watch for:
• Statistical test results (p-values)
• KL divergence values
• Drift alerts
• Recommended actions

Running on local edge device!
Takes ~12 minutes (be patient!)

==========

SLIDE 20A: SCENARIO 1 RESULTS
[SCREENSHOT: Seasonal drift output]

Seasonal Drift Detection:

Baseline (Summer):
• General health: 80%
• Respiratory: 0%

Current (Winter):
• General health: 0%
• Respiratory: 100%

Result:
🚨 DRIFT DETECTED
• KL Divergence: 6.4 (very high!)
• p-value: <0.001 (significant)
• Recommendation: Retrain with seasonal data

Why This Matters:
• Model trained on summer fails in winter
• Automated detection prevents failure
• Same issue on edge or cloud!

==========

SLIDE 20B: SCENARIO 2 RESULTS
[SCREENSHOT: Performance drift output]

Model Performance Degradation:

Baseline:
• Quality: 0.92
• Safety: 1.00
• Latency: 27.7s

Current:
• Quality: 0.70 (-22% ❌)
• Safety: 0.94 (-6%)
• Latency: 50.7s (+83% ❌)

Result:
🚨 DRIFT DETECTED
• Mann-Whitney U test: p=0.10
• Latency drift: 83% increase
• Recommendation: Investigate & retrain

Why This Matters:
• Silent degradation caught early
• Patient safety protected
• Works on any deployment!

==========

SLIDE 20C: SCENARIO 3 RESULTS
[SCREENSHOT: Real-time monitoring]

Real-Time Detection:

Live Testing with phi3:mini:
• Baseline queries (3): Avg quality 0.95
• Current queries (3): Avg quality 0.94
• Result: ✅ No drift (-1.3% change)

Statistical Tests:
• Quality: p=1.00 (no drift)
• Safety: p=0.50 (no drift)
• Latency: -9% (slight improvement)

Why This Matters:
• Continuous monitoring
• Real production scenario
• Model performing consistently
• System would alert if drift detected

==========

==========

SLIDE 26: WHEN TO RETRAIN?
Alert Thresholds:

🔴 Critical:
• Quality < -20% → Immediate retrain
• Safety < 0.90 → Stop serving
• Latency > 2x → Investigate

🟠 Warning:
• Quality -10 to -20% → Schedule retrain
• Latency 1.5-2x → Monitor closely

🟢 Info:
• Quality -5 to -10% → Track trends

Same thresholds for edge and cloud!

==========
